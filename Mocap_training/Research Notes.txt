  # saved massive validation on model dec8_validated_s1-24_j20_l40_b512
      - error graph saved. max error around 7 inches, corresponds to trial 27
      - involved a lot of sideways movement. Clearly unnatural, at least in
        comparison to the other trials largely involving running/walking
  # NOTE  that if most of the data had a certain orientation, the data is skewed
    because it does not see the movement as much if body facing left as is it is
    right
      - fix by training also on a 90 degree rotation?

  # More on fixing orientation problem. Could build a random rotation matrix
   (leave z coordinate alone), rotate whole body by that (between 0 and 360)
   Would just incorporate straight into the generator.
  # Downloaded textbook with adaptive prediction on page 110. Adaptive
  Filtering, Prediction and Control, Kwai Sang in. ref 18 in cheng paper.
  # going to train, randomly rotate each batch
  # TODO also try with randomly rotating every X,Y pair

  # NOTE suspect equation 7 of the cheng paper has incorrect tranpose markings on Phi
      - equation (6) has correct shapes but (7) does not
